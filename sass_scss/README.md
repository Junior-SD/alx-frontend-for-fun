# Sass & Scss

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- **What Sass means:** Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets. It is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
- **How to write Sass & Scss file:** Sass/Scss files are written using a special syntax that extends CSS, allowing for features like variables, nesting, and mixins.
- **What is the difference between Sass and Scss:** Sass originally used indentation to separate code blocks, while Scss uses braces and semicolons, similar to CSS. However, both ultimately compile to the same CSS syntax.
- **What is the Sass preprocessing:** Sass preprocessing is the process of translating Sass or Scss code into standard CSS, which web browsers can understand and render.
- **How to declare a variable:** Variables in Sass/Scss are declared using the `$` symbol followed by the variable name and its value.
- **How to use nested definition:** Nesting in Sass/Scss allows selectors to be nested within one another, improving readability and organization of code.
- **How to import a Sass file:** Sass files can be imported into other Sass files using the `@import` directive.
- **How to use mixins:** Mixins in Sass/Scss are reusable blocks of styles that can be included in other selectors.
- **How to declare extend/inheritance styles:** Extend/inheritance in Sass/Scss allows styles to be inherited from one selector to another using the `@extend` directive.
- **How to manipulate operators:** Sass/Scss supports various operators for performing arithmetic operations within stylesheets.
